# Reaktor  ðŸš€
This is my personal React Starter Kit. It's based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) but with some changed that match by usual stack better.

For now it's a repository I copy for new projects, but might turn it into a Yeoman generator sometime.

## Changes
### Removed
* Support for react-native-web
* Support for CSS (although I might add a Sass + CSS Modules loader later)

### Changed
* Rely on `babel-preset-env` rather than `babel-preset-react`.

###Â Added
* Add `babel-polyfill`
